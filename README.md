# ProActive Dashboard Portal

## Requirements

You need `npm` installed, then run the following commands from the root of the repository to install the required tools and dependencies:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
```

The dashboard subviews are git submodules that need to be retrieved by using the following commands:
```
git submodule init
git submodule sync
git submodule update
```
This repository expects that you have an authorized SSH key to fetch the submodules (they are hosted on private repositories).

## Building

To build the ProActive Dashboard, just use the following command to generate the enterprise version of the dashboard:
```
grunt clean build --target=enterprise
```

Or use this command instead to build the community version:
```
grunt clean build --target=community
```

If no target is specified, grunt will build the enterprise version by default.
Then, copy the `dist/` folder in `scheduling/dist/war/` and rename it "automation-dashboard".

Once scheduling/bin/proactive-server is started, the dashboard is available at:
```
localhost:8080/automation-dashboard
```

### What does building do with subviews modules?

With the following tasks, grunt injects subviews in the dashboard, depending on the requested VERSION :
* replace:
  * in `app/templates_versions/VERSION/config.js`, it sets, for each URL, which view should be displayed
  * in `app/templates_versions/common/navigation.html`, it adds item for the navigation menu (left panel)
  * in `app/templates_versions/VERSION/app.js`, it adds modules needed for subviews
  * in `app/templates_versions/VERSION/index.html`, it adds scripts needed for subviews
  * when all files are replaced accordingly to the requested version, they are copied into the `app/` folder:
    * `app/templates_versions/VERSION/config.js` to `app/scripts/config.js`
    * `app/templates_versions/VERSION/app.js` to `app/scripts/app.js`
    * `app/templates_versions/VERSION/index.html` to `app/index.html`
    * `app/templates_versions/common/navigation.html` to `app/views/common/navigation.html`
* jsbeautifier: re-indents all these files that were not well indented with generated code.
* copy:communitySubviews: copies the community subviews html content (or the _unavailable_ alternative pages if necessary) into the final `dist/` folder.
* copy:enterpriseSubviews: copies the enterprise subviews html content (or the _unavailable_ alternative pages if necessary) into the final `dist/` folder.


## Development

The dashboard have 2 versions available:
* community
* enterprise

Both versions have specificies that are described in the `app/templates_versions/` folder.
Each of those versions is composed of the following files:
* `app.js`
* `config.js`
* `index.html`
* `subviews.json`

When building the dashboard, grunt will first copy those files (depending on the selected version) into the `app/` folder before running the build process, so the 3 following files should NOT be created manually into the `app/` folder:
* `app/index.html`
* `app/scripts/app.js`
* `app/scripts/config.js`

Any modification to those files will need to be done from the `app/templates_versions/VERSION` folder instead. What you want to modify is between `<!-- beginSubviewsScripts-->` and `<!-- endSubviewsScripts-->`, you need to change the way it is generated in `Gruntfile.js` (`replace` task) and `enterprise/community.json`. Otherwise, you can modify enterprise/community sources files.

To add/remove a subview, you need to change `app/templates_versions/VERSION/subviews.json`. If you want a view to be in the portal but with its content not available (visible in the navigation panel but "not available" page displays when you click on it), you need to add it in theses files with the attribute `isAvailable` set to `false`. If a view shouldn't be displayed at all, just remove it from the 2 JSON files.

Views will be displayed in the navigation panel in the same order as they are given in `app/templates_versions/VERSION/subviews.json`. The order of `jsFiles` attribute values is also very important as scripts will be injected in `index.html` in the same order.

Images used in the view must be put in `images` attribute.

All attributes are mandatory, except `initFunction` and `images`, which can be omitted.

### Subviews project

Each subview is defined in a bitbucket repository and then imported in this project as a submodule (see `.gitmodules` file). The branches are important for now, as we still have the subviews building standalone versions as well from their respective master branches.
To modify a subview: open the submodule's folder associated in the proactive-dashboard project, make the modifications, build the **proactive-dashboard** (no need to build the submodule). Once all modifications are done:
1. commit the submodule's changes from its own folder. This is important as the dashboard project relies on the hash of the commits to fetch the correct version of the submodule.
2. commit the dashboard changes, it will detect that changes occured in the submodules, which is fine, you'll also need to add those changes on the submodule to your dashboard commit as well (just add the submodule folder, no need to add the inner changes)

Don't forget that synchronizing your dashboard repo with the master is not going to automatically update the submodules, you'll need to update them with the `git submodule update` command.
